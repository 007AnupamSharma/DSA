What is Hacktoberfest ?

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone and it marks the celebration of Open Source. It's the biggest Open Source event that encourages newbies to participate in Open Source and create their 1st meaningful PR.

You get some awesome goodies which include A limited-edition T-shirt for **FREE!** and some stickers.

⚠️Rules:

✅ Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.

✅ The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

✅ If a maintainer reports your pull request as 'spam' or 'invalid', it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

✅ If a maintainer reports behaviour that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

✅ To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
This year, the first 55,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

⚠️What not to do!

❌ PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)

❌ PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else’s branch/commits and making a PR)

❌ PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

❌ Something that’s clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October
