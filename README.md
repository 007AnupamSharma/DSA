 Quality Standards for Hacktoberfest 
 
     ❌Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.
     
     ❌Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.
     
     ❌Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
     
     ❌Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
     
     ❌Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
